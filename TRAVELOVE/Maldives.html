                <p>The Maldives is a dream destination for many. With all of those islands with little huts on top over crystal clear water and white sand, who doesn't dream of visiting this idyllic island paradise?

I used to think that it was prohibitively expensive to visit the Maldives, and that it was likely out of my reach. Then I took a chance on a cheap flight out and realized that between affordable resorts and locally-owned guesthouses, it's completely possible to have a Maldives vacation that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. 

With amazing underwater life and over 1,000 islands to choose from, there's tons to do in the Maldives for those who love to be in the water. It can also be a unique cultural experience if you want a vacation that's a little different than what your friends are doing. These guides are here to show you that the Maldives can be within reach. </p><br>
                <h2 align="center">Things to Do</h2>
                <p><br><b>Diving:</b> Diving in Maldives is amazing! I remember seeing a reef shark within a few minutes in the water. On the same day, some divers I met told me they saw a whale shark - you can easily spot some seriously impressive underwater creatures here. Diving is possible all year but visibility may be slightly poorer during the rainy season between May – November. Try to find a resort that allows you to take scuba gear out anytime you want so you can squeeze in as many dives as possible.<br><br>

<br><b>Snorkeling &amp; Other Activities:</b> Snorkeling is just as amazing as diving in Maldives. I went on manta and whale shark watching tours and was not disappointed. The Maldives also offers all kinds of activities on the water, such as surfing, water skiing, paragliding, and so on. Just make sure to slather on sunscreen!<br><br>

<br><b>Stay at a Local Guesthouse:</b> Even if you have enough budget for a resort, I’d still suggest experiencing staying with a local guesthouse for a few nights if possible. This is mainly because it is difficult to meet Maldivian people on the resort islands, as they are not allowed to serve alcohol. The locals are kind and friendly, and staying with them normally comes with great conversations, awesome home cooked food and a real sense of how Maldivians eat, live, and love life.<br><br><br>

<b>Visit the National Museum:</b> Go beyond the beach and visit the 3 storey national museum in Male that preserves the Maldivian history and culture. Admission is about $6.5.</p>
                <h2 align="center">Food</h2>
                <p>While most accommodation options take care of your meals, there are local markets on Male, the main island, and some small local restaurants on the local islands that serve local and Sri Lankan food. Items on the menu are fairly limited to seafood and fruit. If you are staying at a resort, you will very likely be served a continental breakfast, and have feasts of fresh seafood or curry for lunch and dinner. Alcohol is expensive unless you’re at an all-inclusive, and only available on the resort islands.</p>
