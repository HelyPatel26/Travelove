            <p>Las Vegas remains one of the most-visited destinations in the world, with gambling, shops, nightclubs, dayclubs, dining, shows and fabulous outdoor opportunities all available within a short drive.
                Racing exotic cars, golfing, arcade games and even machine gun lessons can certainly fill a dance card for the typical three-day visitor. Add outdoor activities such as biking, hiking, rock climbing and horseback riding, and most visitors have plenty of reasons to return.

             <h2 align="center">Things to Do:</h2>
            <p><b>The Neon Museum </b>Las Vegas wouldn’t be nearly as famous as it is without the glowing gas that keeps it lit. Appropriate, then, that the city should have a museum dedicated to the stuff. The main attraction at the Neon Museum is the hourlong guided tour of the outdoor Neon Boneyard, an eerily wonderful, dreamlike place where the city’s old neon signs go to retire (and, in some cases, be restored). Needless to say, this is a popular spot for Instagram accounts and engagement photos.
<br><br><b>The Mob Museum </b>Vegas isn’t nicknamed Sin City for nothing. The town got its start when mobster Bugsy Siegel built the Flamingo; soon enough, bullies, thugs, and murderers were in charge. Only in Las Vegas would there be a whole museum about the mafia—the museum’s full name is the Mob Museum, the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, and it opened in 2012 near Fremont Street.<br><br><b>The Grand Canyon by Helicopter </b>If you’ve already traveled far to visit Las Vegas, it’s worthwhile (and feasible) to add the Grand Canyon to your itinerary. Truly one of the world’s great natural wonders, the canyon’s ancient topography and 6,000-foot-deep gorge make it an undeniable bucket list item. A company called Las Vegas Outdoor Adventures offers helicopter tours from Las Vegas to Grand Canyon National Park; the luxurious flight provides 180-degree views of the canyon and its Colorado River, as well as the Hoover Dam and other regional marvels.
Then your helicopter will actually descend below the Grand Canyon’s rim, an experience you’ll never forget.<br><br><b>The Fremont Street Experience </b>Only in Las Vegas can you see the world’s largest video screen, comprised of more than 12 million LEDs. Viva Vision, suspended and stretched 90 feet above the Fremont Street Experience, is 1,500 feet long and puts on a nightly light and sound show, much to the delight of the pedestrians on the promenade below.
In addition to being immersed in this nightly spectacle, visitors to this entertainment district can shop, eat, gamble, ride SlotZilla (an 850-foot-long zipline) or experience Fear the Walking Dead Survival, an immersive zombie-themed attraction.<br><br><b>Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area </b>Nature’s simple wonders are always superior to even man’s brightest, most sparkling spectacles. This, of course, holds as true in Las Vegas as it does anywhere else. Drive 17 miles from the big, bold strip to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area to be rewarded with sweeping views, exhilarating wildlife sightings, and immersion into one of the world’s most arid landscapes—the Mojave Desert. Dozens of well-maintained trails ensure that every level of hiker is accommodated. Keep an eye out for ancient petroglyphs.<br><br><b>Marvel Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. </b>The Marvel Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. in Treasure Island is part whole-body, multi-room video game, part memorabilia museum relevant to anything having to do with the Avengers. The displays here are all originals, and include Captain America’s uniform and shield, Black Widow’s armor and weapons, Ant-Man’s helmet, Iron Man’s suit, Bruce Banner’s laboratory, and more.
The premise is that you train to be an agent via access to a mobile training device, intelligence files, and other clues. It’s an immersive, high-tech experience, and you’ll walk away with more of a backstory on your favorite characters, with a science-infused twist.</p>
        <h2 align="center">Food</h2>
        <p><b>Durango Taco Shop </b>Head up to Centennial Hills for inexpensive Mexican fare such as chile rellenos, chile verde, carnitas, mojarra, enchiladas, and more for less than $10. Those combination plates include rice, beans, and chips. Lunch specials ring in for $5.99 to $9.99. Also open on East Flamingo Road as well.<br><br><b>Komex </b>Try the fusion taco with your choice of meat with KoMex slaw and pico de gallo on corn tortillas for $2.25 or the fusion tostada, a crispy rice “shell” topped with KoMex slaw and pico de gallo topped with Korean hot sauce, for $6.<br><br><b>Frijoles &amp; Frescas </b>Frijoles &amp; Frescas serves taco meals for $7.49, burrito meals for $9.95, and platters with meat, beans, rice, tortillas, and side salads for $8.99. Make sure to order the popular $2.50 Mexican street corn. Six locations in Las Vegas.<br><br><b>Viva Las Arepas </b>The Venezuelan arepas sandwiches at Viva Las Arepas range from $5.50 to $8 and may be the best bet for an inexpensive sandwich in Las Vegas. Do order the reina pepieda with chicken, avocado, and mayonnaise for $6.50, and thank us later.<br><br></p>
