                <p>Without a doubt, Paris is one of the chicest travel destinations in the world. The City of Light offers the best of everything—from historic cathedrals and incomparable museums to stylish boutiques and unbeatable cuisine.
                There are a thousand things to do and see in Paris and however much time you have here, it won’t be enough!

Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, stroll down the Champs Elysées, visit the Louvre, see many shows and exhibitions, or simply wander along the banks of the Seine...read in French in the Tuileries garden, and quite simply take the time to experience the Parisian way of life!

                    Stepping into this whirlwind that takes you from frenzy to romanticism will leave you with enduring memories. You will be much more proficient in French and you will become aware of your ability to communicate in the language of Molière.</p>

                <p><br><b>The Sacré-Cœur Basilica</b>, designed by Paul Abadie between 1875 and 1914, crowns the summit of Montmartre, the highest point in the city.
                <br><br><b>Eiffel Tower: </b>Devised by Gustave Eiffel in 1889 as the entrance to the World’s Fair, the iron lattice Eiffel Tower that was originally viewed as an eyesore has become an emblem of the City of Light. At the top of the tower visitors can now glimpse the petite apartment—complete with paisley wallpaper and oil paintings—that Eiffel kept for himself and his most prominent friends.
                <br><br><b>The Louvre </b>A central landmark in Paris, the Louvre is a must for anyone visiting France. Originally built to house the royal family in the late 12th century (it officially opened as a museum in 1793), the palace has undergone countless renovations and extensions since, including the installation of I. M. Pei’s iconic glass pyramids—which topped the museum’s new entrance—in 1989.

Established by Louis XIV in 1670 for old or unwell soldiers, the complex of buildings now houses several museums, a church, and—staying true to its origins—a hospital and home for retired soldiers.</p>
